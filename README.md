Tapestry Protocol
=====

Ever since Pretty Good Privacy was released in 1991, cypherpunks have dreamed of a world where web of trust can be used to curate content, facts, and information in a way that routes around powerful entities who wish to isolate, to censor, and to control the flow of information through society. Unfortunately, web of trust has failed to live up to its expectations. Why is that?

We believe that for web of trust to curate content, facts, and information, it must simultaneously curate the digital tools that we use to communicate about those things. The goal of the tapestry protocol is therefore to facilitate creation of the world's first [decentralized digital languages](https://github.com/wds4/tapestry-protocol/blob/main/glossary/decentralizedLanguage.md).

What is a decentralized language? We model language as a long list of [pseudo-arbitrary questions](https://github.com/wds4/tapestry-protocol/blob/main/glossary/pseudoArbitrary.md), and a decentralized language as one in which those types of questions are answered using web of trust. In particular, a decentralized language is one that does not rely upon [stewards](https://github.com/wds4/tapestry-protocol/blob/main/glossary/steward.md), with examples of present-day digital stewards being repository managers and standards committees to manage digital tools of communications. Although today's world of open source software is a tremendous step towards decentralization compared to proprietary software, open source tools remain stewarded and are therefore not as decentralized as they could be.

Armed with the ability to manage decentralized digital languages, the web of trust can finally live up to its expectations in terms of its ability to curate content, facts and information.

# Protocol: [Tapestry Implementation Proposals (TIPs)](https://github.com/wds4/tapestry-protocol/blob/main/tips/README.md)

The tapestry protocol is composed of two major collections of TIPs: the Concept Graph, a set of TIPs for the *representation* of knowledge and information, and the Grapevine, a set of TIPs for delegating the *curation* of knowledge and information to your web of trust.
