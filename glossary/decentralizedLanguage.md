decentralized language
=====

A decentralized language is modelled as a long list of [pseudo-arbitrary](pseudoArbitrary.md) questions about the community's tools and methods of communication, the answers to which are curated using a web of trust-based methodology with no single point of failure; in particular, without the need for [stewards](steward.md).

According to *tapestry theory*, the existence of standard human spoken and written languages is proof that decentralized languages exist.
