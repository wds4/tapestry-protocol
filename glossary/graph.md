graph
======

A graph is a collection of [nodes](node.md) and [edges](relationship.md) (a.k.a. `relationships`). 

According to the [tapestry method](tapestryMethod.md), nodes are chunks of data and can take on any physical form (a digital file, a collection of neurons, a piece of paper, etc) or format: JSON, CSV, JPEG, Sanskrit prose, etc. By convention of the [tapestry protocol](tapestryProtocol.md), most nodes are JSON formatted data files referred to as [words](word.md). 

Edges represent relationships between nodes. Various [relationship types](relationshipType.md) are defined and implemented using several TIPs.
