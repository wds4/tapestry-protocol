pseudo arbitrary
=====

A *pseudo-arbitrary* question is one that has a large number of answers that would be deemed acceptable by the majority of entities within a community, provided only that it is already accepted by the majority of known entities.

Questions can be pseudo arbitrary for several reasons. One reason could be that various alternatives are genuinely equally acceptable from the perspective of the individual entity. Another reason could be that some reasons are marginally more acceptable than others, but only marginally so, and being on the same page as the majority is deemed by the individual to be more important. A third reason could be that the relative acceptability of various alternatives is unknown by the individual entity, but the entitiy estimates that the amount of effort it would require to evaluate the acceptability of various options makes it not worth the expenditure. Such may often be the case in the digital realm, where evaluating the relative acceptability of various options would require an entity who does not know how to code to learn to do so, and then to become an expert in the question at hand.
