steward
=====

In the context of the *tapestry method*, a digital *steward* is an entity who is entrusted by a community with oversight or authority over some aspect of the tools of communication, i.e. over some set of [pseudo arbitrary](pseudoArbitrary.md) questions.

# Examples

Examples of digital stewards include:
- World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Committees as stewards for internet standards
- repository managers as stewards for individual GitHub repositories

# Spoken and written languages

As opposed to the digital realm of today's open source world, the biological realm (human spoken and written languages such as English, etc) has no stewards. If one asks: who is in charge of the words we use to discuss some topic of interest? The question itself may seem nonsensical, because the answer is simultaneously *everybody*: we all just agree on the words we are using -- and *nobody*: no single entity has the power over the rest of us to change the words we use.
