tapestry theory
=====

Tapestry theory is the theory that the [tapestry method](tapestryMethod.md) *should be applied* to the digital realm, and *already describes* the biological realm.

More specifically, *tapestry theory* may refer to either one of the following:
- in the *biological realm*, the theory that the tapestry method is a reasonably accurate description of the organization of the central nervous system (i.e., that the central nervous system can be modelled as an [entity](entity.md), with knowledge organized as a graph with structure provided by [principles of organization](principlesOfOrganization.md)) and is a reasonably accurate description of how languages such as human spoken and written langauges are curated
- in the *digital realm*, the theory that the tapestry method will be an effective method to establish a [decentralized digital language](decentralizedLanguage.md)
