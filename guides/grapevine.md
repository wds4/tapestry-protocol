Incorporation of the Grapevine into your app or platform
=====


This guide is intended for the developer or dev team who wishes to incorporate the Grapevine into a specific application or platform. We will walk through steps and will use a hypothetical decentralized wikipedia application which we will call Pretty Good Wikipedia, or pgWiki, as an example.

Step 1: Statement of General Purpose 

The first step is to create a clear statement of the purpose that the Grapevine will serve in the app in question. This could be as short as one sentence. 

_Pretty Good Apps is a series of apps that each use the Grapevine to enable you and your community to identify who is the most trustworthy, and in what context, so they can help you curate the content, facts, and information relevant to that app._

For example:

In pgWiki, the Grapevine enables you and your community to identify the most trustworthy curators of content, facts, and information.
