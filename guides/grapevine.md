Incorporation of the Grapevine into your app or platform
=====


This guide is intended for the developer or dev team who wishes to incorporate the Grapevine into a specific application or platform. It is divided into two sections: one for the goal, and one for the roadmap. For illustration purposes, we will consider a hypothetical decentralized wikipedia application, built using nostr, which we will call Pretty Good Wikipedia, or pgWiki.

# The Goal 

## Step 1: Statement of General Purpose 

The first step is to create a clear statement of the purpose that the Grapevine will serve in the app in question. This could be as short as one sentence and may be of the following format: _Pretty Good Apps is a series of apps that each use the Grapevine to enable you and your community to identify who is the most trustworthy, and in what context, so they can help you curate the content, facts, and information relevant to that app._

For example: _The Pretty Good Wiki uses the Grapevine to enable you and your community to identify the most trustworthy domain-specific curators for your encyclopedia of content, facts, and information._

## Step 2: Define User Actions

Example:

## Step 3: Define the Data Model

## Step 4: Define How data is Processed

The Grapevine library 

# The Roadmap

In this step, we decide what features will be rolled out and in what order. For pgWiki, the roadmap could be the following:

### Step 1: Initial rollout

Nostr users already maintain a follows list and a mute list which can be used for a rudimentary web of trust.

### Step 2: Explcit attestations
