Decentralized Linguistic Consensus
=====

a.k.a. *loose consensus*
-----

Dencentralized linguistic consensus refers to consensus among a group of [entities](https://github.com/wds4/tapestry-protocol/blob/main/glossary/entity.md) on a language that is reached in the absence of any designated centralized authority, including [stewards](https://github.com/wds4/tapestry-protocol/blob/main/glossary/steward.md). A language curated in this fashion is referred to as a decentralized language, as opposed to a language that requires stewards, referred to as a *stewarded* or *centralized language*.

Examples of decentralized languages include human spoken or written languages such as English or Chinese. Examples of stewarded languages include computer languages such as javascript, stewarded by , or linux stewarded by the linux foundation. Digital standards maintained by the World Wide Web Consortion (W3C) are stewarded by their respected W3C committees.

DLC is also referred to as *loose consensus* due to the fact that consensus is not enforced and is tyically imperfect and incomplete. Among any group of speakers of the English language, for example, there will always be some set of words that some group members know and others do not, or words the meanings of which there will be disagreement.
