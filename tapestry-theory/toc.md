Tapestry Theory: Table of Contents
=====

Work in progress. Being moved from [here](https://github.com/wds4/tribal-tapestry/blob/main/essays/bookJustification/hypotheses/tapestryFoundation.md). Links (below) have not yet been created.

## 1. [Decentralized Linguistic Consensus]()
The purpose of tapestry theory is to provide a solution to the problem of *decentralized linguistic consensus*: how a community of individuals ("entities") can build a language without leaders.

## 2. [Math as the universal model for knowledge representation]()
The mathematics of set theory and graph theory provide the foundation from which decentralized language can be constructed.

## 3. [Knowledge is represented using a graph]()
Knowledge is broken down into small chunks, called *nodes*, which are connected by *edges*, thus forming a graph, a.k.a. the *tapestry*.

## 4. [The nodes of the tapestry can be any chunk of data]()
The tapestry model places no restrictions on the physical structure or data format of individual nodes in the graph.
- In the biological realm, a node is a patch of neurons.
- In the digital realm, a node is an individual computer file.

## 5. [Principles of Organization (PoA)]()
Disparate nodes of the tapestry are knit together (*integrated*) as tightly and extensively as possible via *principles of organization*, which should be as few and as simple as possible.

## 6. [PoA 1: Class Threads]()
Nodes of the tapestry are organized into sets and *concepts* using *class threads*.

## 7. [PoA 2: Pattern Recognition]()
*Concepts* are formatted according to constraint nodes and provide a mechanism to filter new data.

## 8. [Vertical Integration]()
Concepts are integrated vertically using the class propagation edge and the class termination edge (2 of the 3 edges that go into the definition of class threads).

## 9. [Horizontal Integration]()
Constraint nodes are decomposed into properties in a manner designed to facilitate and maximize horizontal integration of the graph.

## 10. [The Nodal versus the Topological Data Layers]()
Information is stored in two layers: the nodal layer and the topological layer. Each layer has relative advantages and disadvantages over the other in terms of efficiency of data search, data processing, and information retrieval, the appreciation of which is crucial for development of the tribal narrative.

## 11. [Normalization]()
The tapestry is normalized: no two nodes of the tapestry are identical.

## 13. [No orphan nodes]()
Every node belongs to (is an instance of) at least one concept.

## 14. [Optimization]()
The topology of the tapestry is optimized for search efficiency and other parameters. This probably occurs on a periodic basis and may be the primary function of sleep.

## 15. [Theory of Mind]()
Theory of mind: each tapestry must contain an internal representation of other entities.

## 16. [Ambiguity]()
A high tolerance for ambiguity of meaning is one of the hallmarks of the tapestry method.

## 17. [Superposition of language and knowledge]()
The layering of language and of knowledge is another of the hallmarks of the tapestry method.

## 18. [Web of Trust]()
Decentralized consensus is achieved using Web of Trust.
