Tapestry Implementation Proposals (TIPs)
=====

# Protocol

## Motivation

This work is motivated by the belief that web of trust cannot successfully curate content, facts, and information if it does not simultaneously curate the digital tools that we use to communicate about those things. 

## Purpose

The purpose of the tapestry protocol is to facilitate creation of the world's first [decentralized digital languages](https://github.com/wds4/tapestry-protocol/blob/main/glossary/decentralizedLanguage.md).

## [Core Protocol: TIPs 0.x](core-protocol)

## [Concept Graph: TIPs 1.x](concept-graph)

## [Grapevine: TIPs 2.x](grapevine)

## [Networking: TIPs 3.x](networking)

## Subprotocols

A subprotocol is a subset of TIPs which serve a particular purpose.

- [DCoSL](subprotocols/DCoSL.md): decentralized curation of simple lists
- [DCoG](subprotocols/DCoG.md): decentralized curation of graphs
  - [DCoG-cat](subprotocols/DCoG-cat.md): DCoG for set trees or category trees

# Tables

- [word types](tables/wordTypes.md)
- [relationship types](tables/relationshipTypes.md)
- [principles of organization](tables/principlesOfOrganization.md)
- table of nostr id (& IPFS hashes?) for published words

# Folders
- folder for each word type: 
- page for JSON Schema 
- page for example of word of that type
