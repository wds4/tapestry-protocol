Tapestry Implementation Proposals (TIPs)
=====

## [Core Protocol: TIPs 0.x](core-protocol)

The core protocol presents an overview of the basic principles of the tapestry method, including its goal: a [decentralized digital language](https://github.com/wds4/tapestry-protocol/blob/main/glossary/decentralizedLanguage.md). Information will be encoded topologically into graphs (the Concept Graph) in a way that facilitates curation by the web of trust (the Grapevine).

## [Concept Graph: TIPs 1.x](concept-graph)

The concept graph achieves *knowledge representation* by organizing information into a graph, governed by a handful of linguistic-overhead-minimizing *principles of organization* which provide structure to the graph.

## [Grapevine: TIPs 2.x](grapevine)

The Grapevine achieves *knowledge curation* using the web of trust in a manner designed to integrate naturally with the Concept Graph.

## [Networking: TIPs 3.x](networking)

A section of the protocol is dedicated to the storage and transmission of data using [nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr). Stubs have also been added for several alternative networks (e.g., IPFS, GUN). Multiple networks can be used simultaneously for the sake of redundancy.

## Subprotocols

A subprotocol is a subset of TIPs which serve a particular purpose.

- [DCoSL](subprotocols/DCoSL.md): decentralized curation of simple lists
- [DCoG](subprotocols/DCoG.md): decentralized curation of graphs
  - [DCoG-cat](subprotocols/DCoG-cat.md): DCoG for set trees or category trees
