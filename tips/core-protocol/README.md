Core Protocol: TIPS 0.x
=====

## Synopsis

We review the underlying principles of the protocol and introduce the concept graph and the grapevine, which are developed in detail in the sections that follow. Although subsequent sections require the incorporation of some [linguistic burden](https://github.com/wds4/tapestry-protocol/blob/main/glossary/linguisticOverhead.md) -- e.g., we make heavy use of json for data files -- the core protocol is designed to contribute minimal, or arguably zero, linguistic burden to the overall protocol. Variations on the tapestry protocol, such as variations that rely upon xml in place of json, could therefore be imagined which adopt the core protocol as is.

## Core Principles: TIPs 0.0.x
- [TIP-0.0.0](purpose.md) The tapestry protocol enables *decentralized digital languages*.
- [TIP-0.0.1](principleOfRelativity.md) no global scores
- [TIP-0.0.2](noGlobalView.md) no global view
- [TIP-0.0.3](explicitAttestations.md) no data scraping
- [TIP-0.0.4](noStewards.md) no digital stewards
- [TIP-0.0.5](noPseudoArbitraryChoices.md) no linguistic overhead for the core protocol
- [TIP-0.0.6](minimizePseudoArbitraryChoices.md) no cathedrals
- [TIP-0.0.7](uniqueIdentifiers.md) unique identifiers
- [TIP-0.0.8](livingTapestry.md) the living tapestry

## Core Methods: TIPs 0.1.x
The Concept Graph and the Grapevine can each function independently, but are each designed to work with the other: the Concept Graph as a method to ask questions, most notably [pseudo-arbitrary](https://github.com/wds4/tapestry-protocol/blob/main/glossary/pseudoArbitrary.md) questions concerning language, and the Grapevine as a method to answer them.

- [TIP-0.1.0](conceptGraph.md) the Concept Graph: representing knowledge as a graph
- [TIP-0.1.1](grapevine.md) the Grapevine: curating knowledge using your web of trust
