Core Protocol: TIPs 0.x
=====

We encode the basic principles and establish the notion that information will be encoded topologically into graphs in a way that facilitates curation by the web of trust. Importantly, the core protocol is designed to have minimal, or arguably zero, [linguistic burden](https://github.com/wds4/tapestry-protocol/blob/main/glossary/linguisticOverhead.md). 

and establish the concept grpah and the grapevine as methods for knowledge representation and knowledge curation, each of which are 

## Core Principles: TIPs 0.0.x
- [TIP-0.0.0](purpose.md) The guiding principle of the tapestry protocol is the creation of *decentralized digital languages*.
- [TIP-0.0.1](principleOfRelativity.md) no global scores
- [TIP-0.0.2](noGlobalView.md) no global view
- [TIP-0.0.3](explicitAttestations.md) no data scraping
- [TIP-0.0.4](noStewards.md) no digital stewards
- [TIP-0.0.5](noPseudoArbitraryChoices.md) no linguistic overhead for the core protocol
- [TIP-0.0.6](minimizePseudoArbitraryChoices.md) no cathedrals
- [TIP-0.0.7](uniqueIdentifiers.md) unique identifiers
- [TIP-0.0.8](livingTapestry.md) the living tapestry

## Core Methods: TIPs 0.1.x
The Concept Graph and the Grapevine can each function independently, but are each designed to work with the other: the Concept Graph as a method to ask questions, most notably pseudo-arbitrary questions concerning language, and the Grapevine as a method to answer them.

- [TIP-0.1.0](conceptGraph.md) the Concept Graph: representing knowledge as a graph
- [TIP-0.1.1](grapevine.md) the Grapevine: curating knowledge using your web of trust
