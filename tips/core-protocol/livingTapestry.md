TIP-0.0.7
=====

the living tapestry
-----

The goal of this protocol is to achieve the living tapestry: the full decentralization of the tapestry protocol. This means that the protocol is managed completely by the web of trust and there is no longer any need for this protocol to be stewarded by a repo manager.

Of note, this may be understood to occur in stages and in varying degrees. Stewardship of individual TIPs rather than stewardship of the entire protocol as a whole should be understood as a step towards the goal of the the living tapestry, even though stewardship will continue to play a role.
