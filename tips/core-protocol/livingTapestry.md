TIP-0.0.7
=====

the living tapestry
-----

The goal of this protocol is to get to the point that it is managed completely by your web of trust. At that point, there will no longer be a need for this repository. It will live in the community.

Of note, this may be understood to occur in stages and in varying degrees. Stewardship of individual TIPs by a myriad of entities rather than stewardship of the entire protocol by a single entity should be understood as a step towards the goal of the the living tapestry, even though stewardship will continue to play a role.
