### TIP-0.0.6
no cathedrals
=====

`draft` `author:wds4`

## Synopsis

The tapestry protocol as a whole will strive to minimize, as much as possible, the [linguistic overhead](https://github.com/wds4/tapestry-protocol/blob/main/glossary/linguisticOverhead.md) of the protocol.

## General Discussion

We define a cathedral as a protocol that is permissive when it comes to linguistic commitments. The notion of a protocol as a cathedral, e.g. bluesky, could therefore be understood to refer to an approach that is counter to the one taken in the tapestry protocol. The "size" of the cathedral, metaphorically speaking, could be estimated as the complexity of the protocol and/or the number of lines of code that must be adopted by anyone who is using the protocol, and could be interpreted as a measure of the linguistic burden associated with that protocol. 

Nostr, in many ways, is the opposite of a cathedral. The only NIP that is absolutely required is NIP-01. Although json is presumed by NIP-01, there are no restrictions placed by the protocol on the types of clients (smartphone, desktop, etc) or on the languages used to build those clients. Nostr protocol, therefore, carries a relatively small linguistic burden compared to a cathedral such as Bluesky.
