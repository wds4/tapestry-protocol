TIP-0.0.6
=====

minimize linguistic burden
-----

This protocol will strive to minimize, as much as possible, the burden of linguistic commitments required for its specification.

The notion of a protocol as a cathedral, e.g. bluesky, could be understood to refer to the opposite approach, one that is permissive when it comes to linguistic commitments. The "size" of the cathedral, metaphorically speaking, could be interpreted as a measure of the linguistic burden associated with the protocol.
