## Synopsis 

No single entity is assumed to have a full "bird's eye" view of everything and / or everybody.

## Discussion

No one is assumed to be able to see the entire web of trust. No one necessarily sees or even knows about the entire community, all of its members, or of all of the data contained therein. No one has access to a complete set of data regarding any individual community. Like much of the tapestry protocol, this is a simple reflection of how the real world works.
