### TIP-0.0.4
no digital stewards
=====

`draft` `author:wds4`

## Synopsis 

This protocol will strive to replace digital stewardship with curation by the web of trust.

## Discussion

Of course, the repository for this protocol is itself an indicator of stewardship. Therefore, one measure of the success of this protocol will be whether it will be eventually possible for stewardship of the tapestry protocol itself to be handed over to the web of trust in a purely decentralized manner, without the need for stewardship. A tapestry protocol curated in this fashion may be referred to as a *living tapestry*.
