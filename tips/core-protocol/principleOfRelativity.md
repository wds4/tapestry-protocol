global scores vs personal scores
-----------

`draft` `author:wds4`

## Synopsis

Pseudo-arbitrary questions, trust and reputation scores are answered and calculated from the perspective of the reference user. There are no "global" answers to pseudo-arbitrary questions or "global" trust and reputation scores.

## General principle

Each user is at the center of his or her web of trust, and each user's lists are curated independently. 

This principle is elaborated more fully here: [Principle of Relativity for the Web of Trust](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/Principle-of-Relativity-for-WoT.md)
