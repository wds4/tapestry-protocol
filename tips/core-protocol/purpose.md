### TIP-0.0.0
The tapestry protocol enables *decentralized digital languages*.
=====

`draft` `author:wds4`

## Synopsis

The tapestry protocol is designed and organized to enable the creation and maintenance of [decentralized digital languages](https://github.com/wds4/tapestry-protocol/blob/main/glossary/decentralizedLanguage.md).

## Discussion

The tapestry protocol itself is designed around the singular goal of curation of a decentralized digital language. Everything else is secondary. Many of the TIPs in the core protocol can be understood as an enumeration of the restrictions placed upon us by that goal. Without understanding those restrictions, the design of the protocol would likely not make much sense.

What do we mean when we say that *everything else is secondary*? The tapestry protocol enables the web of trust to curate content facts, and information. In the past, this has always been considered to be the primary purpose of web of trust. We believe web of trust cannot perform the duties of content, facts, and information if it cannot simultaneously curate the language used to communicate about those things. Curation of the language must therefore be the top priority.
