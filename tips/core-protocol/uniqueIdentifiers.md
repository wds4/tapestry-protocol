`draft` `author:wds4`

## Synopsis

## Discussion

*Unique identifiers* will be used to refer to individual nodes and edges, so that different entities can communicate. The question will arise: unique to what environment? A variety of environments will be utilized, including *universally unique identifiers* (such as cryptographic hashes) and *locally unique identifiers*, such as the username used for an entity under the assumption that no other entity in some specified local community uses the same username, with no guarantee that the same username might not be used in some alternate community.
