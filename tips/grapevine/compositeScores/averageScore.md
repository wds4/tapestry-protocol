average score
=====

## Synopsis

The average score is one of the components of the `composite average score`. It is calculated as a weighted average from one (or more) input ratings Ri, each of which has a numberic field with a minimum and maximum value, such as 1 - 5 or 0 - 100. 

## Discussion

The weight is typically a function of the influence score of the rater, which is context-dependent.
