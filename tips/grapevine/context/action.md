## Synopsis

Action is one of the dimensions of `context`.

## Discussion

Context typically takes the form: Alice trusts Bob `to do an action` `in some particular category`. For example: Alice trusts Bob to write the screenplay for a comedy. In this case `to write the screenplay` is the action, and `comedy` is the category.

## Examples

Some examples of actions include:
- to curate
- to rate
- to create
- to write
- to produce
- to edit
- to recommend
- to give advice
