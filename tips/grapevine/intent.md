### TIP-2.0.0
statement of intent
=====

`draft` `author:wds4`

## Synopsis

The intent of the grapevine is to help find quality content that the user is looking for, even if it is the proverbial needle in the haystack. The protocol is not designed as a tool for advertisers and is not designed to distract you with social media influencers.
