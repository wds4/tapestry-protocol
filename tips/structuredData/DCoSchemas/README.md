DCoSchemas
=====

## Synopsis

This TIP defines the data model that corresponds to a schema as per schema.org and the protocol used to curate a set of structured data that follows that data model.

## Discussion

We will take the basic methodologies of the DCoSL and DCoSG protocols and adapt them with additional restrictions.

## Node Types

According to schema.org, every node in the schema must belong to one of these node types:
- Types
- Data Types
- Properties
(more ?)

Accordingly, each node type will be curated independently using DCoSL.

## Relationship types

- isAPropertyOf
- isASubtypeOf
