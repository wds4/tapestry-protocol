### TIPS 3.x

Curation of Structured Data organized according to Data Model by the Grapevine
=====

## Data Models, Data Structures, and Structured Data Basics: TIPs 3.0.x
- [3.0.0]() Basic idea: start with simple data structures, gradually get more complex
- [3.0.x]() data models
- [3.0.x]() structured data: an instance of a data model
- []() Word Types

## DCoSL: decentralized composite average scores: TIPs 3.0.x
- (is average score as a data structure distinct from the previous TIPs?)
- [2.3.1.0](dataStructures/simpleRanking/simpleRanking.md) intro to composite average score
- [2.3.1.1]() 
- [2.3.1.2]()

## DCoSL: decentralized curation of simple lists: TIPs 3.0.x
- [2.3.2.0](dataStructures/DCoSL/DCoSL.md) DCoSL intro
- [2.3.2.1]() average score subtype
- [2.3.2.2]() cutoff parameters

## DCoG: decentralized curation of graphs: TIPs 3.0.x
- [2.3.3.0](dataStructures/DCoSL/DCoSL.md) DCoG intro
- [2.3.3.1]() 
- [2.3.3.2]()
- ## DCoG-DAG: decentralized curation of graphs that are DAGs and have a master node and one type of relationship type (action, category, subset)
- ## DCoG-property: DCoG for property tree

## curation of a concept

## curation of schemas (as per schema.org)

## content algorithms (rank a list by score)
- multivariable (weight by more than one quality score, weight for age of content, etc)
