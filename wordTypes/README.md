word types
=====

In this section, there is a folder for the most important types of words defined by the protocol for the basic implementations of the concept graph and the grapevine. Each folder contains two files:
- declaration: this file can be used to flesh out either a list or a concept corresponding to that word type
- jsonSchema: this file describes the expected format for words of the specified word type
